# Wyckoff-accumulation-model-train-and-test
Detect and analyze Wyckoff accumulation patterns in financial markets using machine learning. 
This repository contains the code for training and testing the Wyckoff accumulation model
on historical time series data of various forex currency pairs.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
this project focuses on the detection of Wyckoff accumulation patterns in financial
markets using machine learning techniques. By training an LSTM model on a dataset of price
pattern data, the project aims to develop a website that provides real-time notifications when
Wyckoff patterns are identified for specific currency pairs and timeframes.
The proposed solution offers traders and investors an efficient and accurate tool for pattern
recognition, enhancing their ability to make informed trading decisions. The project combines
a machine learning algorithm(LSTM), real-time data flow, and quick user-friendly notifications for
accurate pattern detection in financial markets.
